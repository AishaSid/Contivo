    "Agent 2: Generated script: (VISUAL: A digital blank canvas slowly fills with an intricate, never-before-seen abstract painting. Text fades onto a screen, forming a unique poem. A melody, clearly distinct and new, begins to play.)\nVoiceover: For generations, creativity was a uniquely human domain. But now, artificial intelligence isn't just assisting; it's inventing. Witness algorithms that conjure breathtaking art from scratch, generate compelling narratives without prior prompts, and compose original musical scores that stir the soul. This is creativity reborn.\n(VISUAL: Quick cuts showcasing diverse AI-generated content: a fantastical creature emerging from pixels, a fashion design rendered in 3D, a complex architectural blueprint unfolding, then a snippet of AI-composed orchestral music.)",
